# Diabetes-prediction
We use a single algorithm in the proposed system, which lowers the time complexity.SVM (Support 
Vector Machine) is a machine learning technique used to predict diabetes.We are able to take into account 
patient data regardless of age or gender.The suggested system is an interactive application that asks the user 
to enter data in order to generate a prediction.
The updated dataset under consideration includes the following attributes: gender, age, heart disease, 
hypertension, smoking history, BMI, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, glucose level, and outcome.The 
proposed system takes into account patients who are younger than 21.
